# Part IV Project 2023: Analysing injury patterns of rugby players after mild traumatic brain injury by combining advanced MRI and machine learning techniques

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is defined as an alteration in brain function or other evidence of brain pathology, caused by an external force, and is a leading cause of death and disability. More than 90% of all TBIs are classified as mild in severity (mTBI). Despite the ‘mild’ classification, many mTBIs result in long-term impairment including lifelong physical, cognitive, behavioural and emotional consequences (as well as a financial burden). New Zealand (NZ) has one of the highest rates of mTBI among the developed world, with Māori disproportionally affected. Rangatahi Māori (youth), in particular, are more susceptible to
mTBI and have a significantly higher chance of suffering neurocognitive deficits from concussion. The cause of the higher mTBI incidence among Māori is unknown.

A 1-year longitudinal study was recently performed on rugby players (n=40) in Gisborne, analysing structural brain changes arising from playing contact sports, using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The data suggests that the brain tracts that control motor and cognitive functions are the most significantly affected. Moreover, a novel MRI data fusion algorithm was developed to  quantitatively characterize subtle changes in the brains of rugby players, which has not been possible to measure in the past.

This longitudinal study is continuing this year, following a total of 100 participants, making the dataset one of the most comprehensive mTBI dataset in New Zealand, if not in the world.

Outcome of the project:

1. Analyse advanced brain MR images of rugby along with their impact severity measured with wearable sensors to develop personalised computational model of the brain (called the virtual brain) and analyse the brain injury patterns quantitatively.
2. Develop a machine-learning/statistical model that can predict the pattern of changes in the human brain given symptom measurements and head impact history.
